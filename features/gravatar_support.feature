  Scenario: The Aurium's gravatar picture must link to his gravatar profile
    # because Aurium has his picture registered at garvatar.com.
    When I go to article "My Article"
    Then I should see "Aurium (unauthenticated user)" linking to "//www.gravatar.com/24a625896a07aa37fdb2352e302e96de"

  @selenium
  Scenario: The NoOne's gravatar picture must link to Gravatar homepage
    # because NoOne <nobody@colivre.coop.br> has no picture registered.
    When I go to article "My Article"
    Then I should see "NoOne (unauthenticated user)" linking to "//www.gravatar.com"
