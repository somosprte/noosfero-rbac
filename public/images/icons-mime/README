mime icons in Noosfero
======================

Icon                     Source Theme   License
------------------------ -------------- -------
gnome-mime-text-html.png dlg-neu        GPLV2+
gnome-mime-empty.png     Nuovo          GPLV2+
ico-feed-on.png          <None>         GPLv3

The icons in this directory are taken from some GNOME theme with compatible
license (i.e. GPLV2+ or GPLv3), section "mimetypes/". We take the SVG files and
convert to 24x24 PNG images, so these icons are in fact derived works of those
in the themes.

Some icons are not taken from themes (e.g. ico-feed-on.png was made by Aurélio
A. Heckert <aurelio@colivre.coop.br> and is licensed under the GNU General
Public License, version 3.)

Structure
=========

To keep a trace back to original themes, when rasterizing the SVG files we keep
the original filenames (replacing .svg by .png, obviously) and create symbolic
links with names more sensible for Noosfero.

Icons rasterization
===================

With rsvg, from the librsvg2-bin package (i.e. we use the same rasterization
library as GNOME, so the icons must look like they do in GNOME).

$ rsvg -w 24 -h 24 <ICON>.svg <ICON>.png
