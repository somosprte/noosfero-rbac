README - Comment Classification Plugin
======================================

This plugin creates the structure for classifying the comments. The
initial idea of this plugin is to support the management of public
consulting, but it can be used in different contexts.
For now, two kind of classification will be available:

  * Label: when creating a comment, the user identify the kind of it by
choosing the label of the comment. Example: "Suggestion",
"Disagreement"...
  * Status: users with permission can include a Status for a comment.
Example: "Merged", "Unmerged"

This plugin was developed to help public consulting and needs the
