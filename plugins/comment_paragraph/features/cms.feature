  As a noosfero user
  I want to create a discusssion article

  Background:

  Scenario: discussion article should save content body
  Given I am on joaosilva's control panel
  And I follow "New" within "#section-content"
  When I follow "Comments Discussion"
  And I fill in "Title" with "My discussion"
  And I fill in tinyMCE "article_body" with "My discussion body!!!"
  And I follow "Save"
  Then I should see "My discussion body!!!"
