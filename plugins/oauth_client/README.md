Callback
========

This is the callback path that you need to use in your app configuration:

/plugin/oauth_client/public/callback


Varnish Settings
================
If varnish has been used in your stack, you've to bypass the cache for signup page and prevent cookies to be removed when calling the oauth_client plugin callback. E.g.:

```
if (req.url !~ "^/account/*" && req.url !~ "^/plugin/oauth_provider/*" && req.url !~ "^/plugin/oauth_client/*" && req.http.cookie !~ "_noosfero_.*") {
  unset req.http.cookie;
  return(lookup);
}
```

Using Oauth Provider Plugin
===========================
The oauth_provider plugin may be used as a provider in the same noosfero installation that hosts your oauth_client plugin (this is usefull in a multi environment setup).

However, you've to use a distinct set of thin processes to handle the authorization requests (to avoid deadlock).

Apache settings example:
```
RewriteRule ^/oauth_provider/oauth/(authorize|token).*$ balancer://noosfero-oauth-provider%{REQUEST_URI} [P,QSA,L]
```
