README - RecentContent (RecentContent Plugin)
================================

RecentContent is a plugin that provides a blog which displays the content posted inside a blog chosen by the user.

The RecentContent block will be available for all layout columns of communities, people, enterprises and environments.

The articles posted from the chosen blog are displayed as a list with a link for the title and optionally the abstract/lead content.

If the chosen blog has a cover image, the user can configure the block to show the same image displayed on that blog.

Galleries and folders are not displayed in this block.
